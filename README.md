# Moon Rider: Capybara Mod
Basically I replaced the beats on the left hand side with capybaras. It should work on Windows 11 but you need to use the legacy OpenSSL launch argument when running it due to the OG codebase relying on half-functional depreciated code. Otherwise it works the same as Moon Rider.
